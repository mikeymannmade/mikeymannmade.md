So with being cooped up in the house for months on end due to the recent plague and having recently gotten freedom from the navy's grasp. I needed to go for a walk. This was my first planned solo journey and it was a great proof of concept trip that gave me valuable experience for future expeditions.

So to describe the journey for what it was: I walked out my front door in Everett walked to Duvall on highway 2, then I walked the Snoqualmie Valley Trail to connect with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail (Palouse to Cascades Trail). Finally I stayed on the trail through the pass to then end the trip in Othello. The total trek to Coeur D'Alene would've been 337 miles in total however there were portions that were too unsafe to walk on foot forcing me to hitch hike and once I made it to Othello, I had to cut it short due to missing bridges and live train tracks. Over all I travelled 222 miles and walked roughly 200 miles.

There were quite a few things that I didn't get any footage of such as walking through all those tunnels with out a working flashlight and my standoff with a skunk that ended as well as it could've (with them running off.) So I'm sorry for not being able to show you anything more. But I can tell you all about it here.

So on average I got about fifteen miles per day, sometimes more, sometimes less. The daily routine was sunrise to sunset and I tired to read a chapter, eat, wash my face, then be packed and walking before sunrise. Throughout the day I'd take breaks and eat, taking several photos, listening to music and audio books (I completely powered through Dune while walking). When I decided I've walked far enough (usually around 2 or 3pm) I set up camp and explored. Once it got to around 6 I'd get back to camp to eat and turn down for the night with my book. I brought earth sea with me, great book.

Being alone on a journey like this could be very scary at moments, there were a few others walking the trail close to a town or they might've been on bike in the deeper parts, so if the worst were to happen, I'd at least be found quickly. But armed with nothing but a 6' long staff and a noisy cheery attitude, I felt very safe the entire way through. In the end my only encounter was a skunk, and even then we both walked away unscathed. I did swear that if it sprayed me it'd be the last thing it ever did. I believe the message got across.

Feeling safe though is one thing, being safe however, is totally different. I was constantly aware of my surroundings, looking behind me often to check if I was being stalked by anything. There was never a moment that my staff was out of arm's reach, and I was constantly training with it both while I walked and while at camp. The the thought was to wave it around really hard to look mean and make a loud whooshing sound.

As I finish writing this I realize that its been over a month since I started my walk, and I still feel that peace within my evening walks with my lovely partner. Next time I go I'll bring them and there'll be much better photos.

What a great break from everything. 10/10 would recommend.
