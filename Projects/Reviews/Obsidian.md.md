I really like this program. Obsidian is a simple [[Markdown|markdown]] text editor that allows you to link notes together. Organically, over time and using the [[Zettelkasten Method]], you will develop a complex network of your notes giving you a sort of artificial photographic memory.

Mann Made is meant to be a sort of persuasive demonstration as to what it is capable of and why I think everyone should learn how to use it. The website, however, is hosted using their paid feature Obsidian Publish and is unfortunately not yet compatible with the community-made plugins so most of the features available go unseen. 

I strongly encourage getting it for yourself and learning how to customize it for your specific needs. A quick search on YouTube will show you that there are hundreds of hours and even entire channels dedicated to teaching people how to use the program and the community plugins.
