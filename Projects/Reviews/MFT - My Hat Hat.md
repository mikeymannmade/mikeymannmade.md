# My Hat Hat

The story behind this guy was a few months back when I still had my Facebook account, but before I tell it I have to say something first. I hate the concept of personalized advertisements. Companies track and record user data to autonomously create a sort of psychological profile of you in order to know what you're more likely to spend money on and I believe this spying is horribly immoral and disgusting and I'm really hopeful we'll one day value human health over collecting more money.

With this disgust I have tried to shield myself as much as possible from these companies and while I feel I've done a good enough job protecting myself at least a little bit more than the average person, I'm still on the internet. So there is data to harvest, and the data they do gives them the impression I am obsessed with hentai phone games. Pretty much all of the ads I see are on YouTube on my phone because I have ad blockers on everything else, and it's either this toxically masculine guy selling a shampoo a wa.gov PSA or the AFK hentai broad shaking their bazoogas at me for 5 seconds before I get the chance to skip those unappealing sites.

Now a few months back and I'm scrolling through fb and slowly poisoning my mind when suddenly...

... they finally showed me something I wanted. I introduce you to the Hat Hat by a little company in California called Dad Brand Apparel. I cant tell how fast I bought this thing, I didn't even realize that I had pulled out my card until I, with out a single thought, had typed in most of the numbers and proceeded to press confirm payment. I did not know nor did I care how much it costed me, I simply had to have it.

This Hat Hat has been a permanent part of my attire and if I were to get buried when I die, it would be on my head, but I've already decided for cremation so this thing will be passed on to future generations probably. But I don't need to worry about that because I'm going to live forever, but that's a different conversation.
