# A Wizard of Earthsea

My copy of A Wizard of Earthsea, by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], was my friend's second copy that he bought solely to give to someone else, and I was the friend he decided to give it to. Thanks D this was such a fun read!

This one isn't the shortest read but it definitely isn't a long one. I think this story overall is about self-exploration, humility, and taking responsibility for your actions, but above all this is a coming of age story.

This book is Ms. Le Guin's first young adult novel, and the first in what later became the Earthsea series spanning 5 additional books, and I am looking forward to the next ones. The world she crafted is massive, even as you perceive it through the main character's eyes. In the book are the maps of the lands of the archipelago our cast resides in, and they are quite beautiful in my opinion. They really show the effort Le Guin put into her work.

We follow young Ged, or Sparrowhawk as he is later famously known, as he transitions from abused an child, to one of the most powerful wizards of Earthsea. He battles dragons and the will's of other dark forces all the while coming to terms with his greatest mistake and learning how to fight an unknown creature with no name.

I really liked this book, my favorite character is Ogion, Sparrowhawk's first master. There's a scene where, having returned to his master he shows humility and begs to learn under Ogion again, the old wizard replies and I quote "better late than never". 

This was a quick read for me but I savored every moment in Ms. Le Guin's beautiful story. 

10/10 please read!
