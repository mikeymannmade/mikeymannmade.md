# The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsène Lupin
[[Maurice Leblanc|by Maurice LeBlanc]]

This one... Wow.

I’ve read many books in my day, and this is one of the few to have ever made me laugh out loud. I don’t mean a chortle or one of those quiet exhales through your nose when you watch a funny movie alone. I mean, I actually out loud laughed for like 20 seconds at one point.

The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsène Lupin, much like the famous [[Sherlock Holmes]], is a character who outsmarts everyone around him, and his name alone is enough to bring both terror and awe. Arsène Lupin, the Gentleman Burglar, is a fantastic character that is constantly compared to Holmes for his intelligence, charisma, and especially for his infamy in his line of work. In fact, the two cross paths a few times later in the story.

Arsène Lupin is a burglar, but Lupin does not trouble himself with the sometimes savage tactics the other members of his profession use. Instead, he uses guile, charisma, and a plethora of disguises to convince his soon-to-be victims to hand their goods over to him willingly, or he simply takes them as if he could walk through walls.

[[Maurice Leblanc|Maurice Leblanc’s]] style of writing is so extraordinarily fluid and hilarious that once you get started, you’ll be either unable to stop reading. Or you’ll think you’ve been reading for barely 20 minutes, only to find Lupin himself has reached out from the pages and taken hours of your day without you even noticing. 

From amazing heists to a wonderfully orchestrated prison break Arsène Lupin does everything but disappoint. 

10/10 would recommend
