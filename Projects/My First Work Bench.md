# My First Work Bench

7MAR2021

So this monstrosity was built over the course of a week as I slowly acquired the parts and pieces to assemble it.

The parts are as follows:

- $00 - One free table from craigslist
- $10 - four offcut 2x8's
- $20 - casters
- $00 - free vise
- $10 - nuts, bolts, and screws
- $40 -Â  plywood (I bought 2x what I needed)
- $0.16 - improvised washers
- $80.16 total.

While that isn't a bad price for even a shitty workbench, I still only paid that much due to my impatience. This build has taught me about all the free shit that's out there and that if I ever decide to make a new bench it will cost even less.

As of posting this (and as you could probably tell by the pile of tools) this project isn't completely finished yet. I am going to install shelves drawers and boxes and I will also be wiring some electrical outlets to the table. But that will be a future post.

10/10 would recommend.
