# A Survival Guide to Homelessness

7FEB2022

So for the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a sort of homelessness guide or urban survival guide. In the book, I want to write, in no particular order, about the topics below:  

- Different levels of homelessness
- Trustafarians
- Van Life
- “Choosing to be homeless.”
- Homeless in your car
- Homelessness and Mental illness
- Homelessness and Addiction
- Homeless and pregnant/with children
- Female and Homeless
- BIPOC and Homeless
- LGBTQIA+ and homeless
- Homelessness as a veteran
- Homeless during a pandemic
- Local resources and how to find them
- Road safety
- First Aid
- Basic immunology
- Importance of hygiene
- Urban and wild camping/survival/tacticool tips and tricks
- Weather forecasting by eye
- Moral and networking reasons to volunteer
- Book recommendations
- Free certificates and education
- Transportation
- Wealth gap
- panhandling etiquette 
- Busking
- Guerrilla gardening
- National Parks
- Hotel Vouchers
- Pets
- Interviews and letters from homeless persons around the US (World?)
- Self-defense and weapons
- Clothing
- Storage
- Getting employed and keeping a job
- Hobo codes
- Open to suggestions for more topics

I have been compiling together different resource websites, youtube videos, blog posts, and how-to guides on the above topics, but that’s just the minor details of the book. The hard part, and what I’m most interested in, is collecting interviews and letters from anyone with past or present experience with homelessness. I want to hear from those who have personally gone through homelessness and from family and friends of those people because homelessness doesn’t just affect those starving with nowhere to go on a cold night.

Interspliced between hand-drawn diagrams, statistics, and various tips and tricks, I want to relate some of these personal stories and interviews. The goal is to give some perspective that far too many people higher up on the economic ladder (even those just one step up) seem to lack. I want their ideas for this book and help me get as much experience-based information as possible. More importantly, though, what put them in this situation? What impact have these circumstances put them through, and if/how there is a path to escape their situation.

I hope to clarify that we’re all people and express sonder for those in poverty. In one of the most challenging parts of my life, I used the little savings I had to wander the PNW. I made many friends, some of them lifelong, and was hurt by a few as well. While this insight into homelessness was minimal and only lasted a few months, it was apparent to me the lasting impact if you did not have a way out. American society and culture are structured to keep lower-class people as quiet consumer wage-slaves. Other than being born with the right parents, the only alternative is homelessness or a life of crime in and out of jail. And as far as I could tell, if you were sick with depression or any other mental illness, you’re just too gay or trans or had no access to a loving family that offered resources you were comfortable taking. You would never have a way out.

So this is my idea to help in my little way a book that gives the gathered knowledge of the seasoned veterans of homelessness, the experts in their field of urban survival. If I ever actually get this thing written before anyone steals my idea. I would like to sell it to anyone who can afford it. It might be popular with the doomsday prepper or grey man audience. Still, ultimately, my goal is to have as many copies as possible donated to shelters, low-income resource programs, etc.

I’m still working on the layout and structure of this website, so I’ll update this post when I figure out a “contact me here” thing all set up*. I should be getting a PO box soon, so I’ll add that address here once I’ve done that. That being said, I’m looking for suggestions and experiences, so if you have any, leave a comment for now, or if you know someone else who does share this post with them, if you don’t know anyone of the sort, then you should just share this post and spread the word.
