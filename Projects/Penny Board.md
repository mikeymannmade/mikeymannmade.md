So I almost broke my leg on this thing after having made it just 4 hours prior. That being said look at this thing and at how pretty it is. It veers to the left a little because I messed up the drilling process, thus we thank the gods of impatience and chant our mantra "Cut twice measure once."

This one was pretty spendy:

- $10 - Ikea footrest
- $60 - trucks
- $20 - Dimond purple spacers
- $30 - wheels
- $15 - bearings
- $?? - griptape (not bought yet)
- $135 total

So here I was walking around town thrifting when i see this little shitty footrest that was just four aluminum legs screwed haphazardly into this beautiful piece of wood. Immediately I knew it was destined to be a penny board (for those of you that don't know what a penny board is, it's a really short skateboard.)

I should've waited to find parts for cheap online instead of just going to Zumiez. It would be a waste of money if this thing wasn't so damn cool looking and fun to ride, however I am still resting my ankle after a week so I'll practice on the carpet for now.

8/10 would recommend
