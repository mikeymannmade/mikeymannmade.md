Introducing Graffite Mining Co.

I wanted to show you something pretty cool that I've been lucky enough to be apart of! Graffite Mining Co is a new company we started where we harvest and process graffiti by peeling it right off the walls! There are peoples who make this stuff but we're wholistic af so we only harvest from spots with decades worth of graffiti. The pieces in this post are from a wall with 20 years worth of graffiti on it.

We take these giant chunks and carve them into smaller ingots like this one here. After we sand them down to reveal its most unique property.

We only have a few options for sale for now like the raw material itself, sobriety tokens, and cabochons. But other artists have already started making some beautiful use of the stuff!
