So this one is a gift to my partner, the inspiration came from when they mentioned wanting to write in the bath. This was a good experiment in staining and waterproofing.

Cheap project for once:

$5 - can of stain

It may be a very simple build yes but this is an example of ingenuity at its finest. There was a problem (my partner wanted to write/read while they took a bath) and by thinking about how to solve that while looking at the resources available to me. I quickly realized the solution was two pieces of wood and some stain.

I hope that this is appreciated and used often by my roommates, I for one am planning on taking baths much more regularly.

10/10 definitely recommended
