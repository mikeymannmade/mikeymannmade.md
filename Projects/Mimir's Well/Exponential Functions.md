# Exponential Functions

$$f(x) = a(b)^x$$
$a =$ Initial value
$b =$ Growth or Decay rate as a decimal

- $|b|>1 =$ Exponential Growth, the function $f(x)$ grows exponentially as $x$ increases. For example, $2^x$ grows much faster than $x^2$ as $x$ gets larger.
- $0 < |b| < 1 =$ Exponential Decay, the function $f(x)$ decays exponentially as $x$ increases. For instance, $(0.5)^x$ gets smaller and smaller as $x$ increases.
- $-b =$ X-Axis Reflection
- $-x =$ Y-Axis Reflection
