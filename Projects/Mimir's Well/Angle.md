The union of two [[Ray|rays]].

Greek letters such as theta $\theta$ , phi $\phi$ , alpha $\alpha$, beta $\beta$, gamma $\gamma$ are often used as variables for measuring an angle.

Lay two [[Ray|rays]] atop of one another, rotate one ray at a shared endpoint called a *Vertex* and leave the other fixed. The fixed ray is the *Initial Side* and the rotated ray is the *Terminal Side*.

The measure of an angle is the amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side.

One way to measure this distance is with *[[Degrees]]*. One degree, or $1^\circ$, is $\frac{1}{360}$ of a circular rotation.

Another way to measure circles is with *[[Radians]]*
