Here is where i put my scrap wood. I should've put the roof boards vertically instead of horizontally and I still need to put a diagonal support to fight the wind but it's held up so far otherwise.

This was a fun build and I had a lot of fun working on it with my big sister. It took something like 2 hours to build and its a great alternative to what was once just a pile of wood in the dirt. Cost for this one was just labor and getting to bullshit with my sister so I feel pretty good about this one.

10/10 a good time
